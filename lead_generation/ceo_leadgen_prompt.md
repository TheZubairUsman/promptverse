```json
[
  {
    "person_name": "",                 // Full name of the CEO/founder
    "role": "",                        // e.g., CEO, Co-Founder
    "company_name": "",
    "company_type": "",                // e.g., SaaS, Agency, E-commerce
    "location_country": "",
    "location_city": "",
    "website": "",                      // company website URL
    "linkedin_profile": "",             // URL if public
    "facebook_profile": "",             // URL if public
    "x_profile": "",                    // Twitter/X URL if public
    "contact_email": "",                // only public/professional emails (no guesses)
    "contact_number_public": "",        // only if published publicly (company phone or mobile)
    "whatsapp_number_public": "",       // only if explicitly published for business contact
    "potential_need": "",               // 1-2 sentence actionable insight (why they may need services)
    "outreach_snippet": "",             // 1 short punchy DM/subject line (max 140 chars)
    "source_link": ""                   // direct link to the public source that shows contact or signal
  }
]
```

## Priority Rules
1. If multiple public contact points exist, prefer professional/company emails and LinkedIn profiles.
2. Do not infer or guess emails or phone numbers (no permutations, no pattern guesses).
3. Exclude personal/private social profile links unless they are clearly used for business outreach.
4. If contact is only available via a contact form, include the form URL in `source_link` and set `contact_email` empty.
5. Mark any lead where contact info is behind paywall or requires login as SKIP — include the public source that proved it.

## Format & Quality
- Return valid JSON only — no extra commentary.
- Each `potential_need` must be concise and tied to a verifiable signal (cite the source in `source_link`).
- `outreach_snippet` should be outcome-driven, tailored to the potential need.

## Ethics and Legal
